//! # bit_ops
//!
//! ## About
//!
//! Common bit-oriented operations on primitive integer types with a focus on
//! `no_std` and `const` compatibility. Unlike other crates that provide tooling to
//! create sophisticated high-level types with bitfields, the focus of `bit_ops` is
//! on raw primitive integer types.
//!
//! ## API
//!
//! This crate exports a Function API and a Trait API. The Function API is
//! the foundation and provides `no_std` and `const`-compatible functions. The
//! Trait API won't be `const`-compatible unless `const` trait methods are
//! supported by Rust (stable). This is not the case in Mid-2024 and the
//! next months in Rust stable. `bit_ops` will adapt, as soon as this
//! changes.
//!
//! Note that the most trivial bit operations, such as `"shift_bits"` or
//! `"keep_bits"` won't be covered by the API, as this would introduce a
//! convoluted way around the standard operators `<<`, `>>`, and `&`. Only
//! non-trivial non-oneliners are covered by the API as well as operations,
//! where the semantic name provides a value-add over a (possible even oneliner)
//! (combination of) bit operation.
//!
//! ### Function API
//!
//! For each primitive unsigned integer type, there is a module with the
//! same set of functions:
//!
//! - [`bitops_u8`]
//! - [`bitops_u16`]
//! - [`bitops_u32`]
//! - [`bitops_u64`]
//! - [`bitops_u128`]
//! - [`bitops_usize`]
//!
//! #### Example
//!
//! The following example shows a real-world scenario where several properties
//! are encoded in a single `u64` representing an x86 IOAPIC redirection entry.
//!
//! ```rust
//! // PREREQUISITES: Some Definitions
//!
//! /// See specification of the x86 IOAPIC redirection entry for more details.
//! mod x86_ioapic {
//!     pub const VECTOR_BITS: u64 = 8;
//!     pub const VECTOR_SHIFT: u64 = 0;
//!     pub const DELIVERY_MODE_BITS: u64 = 3;
//!     pub const DELIVERY_MODE_SHIFT: u64 = 8;
//!     pub const DESTINATION_MODE_BITS: u64 = 1;
//!     pub const DESTINATION_MODE_SHIFT: u64 = 11;
//!     pub const PIN_POLARITY_BITS: u64 = 1;
//!     pub const PIN_POLARITY_SHIFT: u64 = 13;
//!     pub const TRIGGER_MODE_BITS: u64 = 1;
//!     pub const TRIGGER_MODE_SHIFT: u64 = 15;
//!     pub const MASKED_BITS: u64 = 1;
//!     pub const MASKED_SHIFT: u64 = 16;
//!     pub const DESTINATION_BITS: u64 = 8;
//!     pub const DESTINATION_SHIFT: u64 = 56;
//! }
//!
//! use x86_ioapic::*;
//!
//!  // ACTUAL LIBRARY USAGE BEGINS HERE
//!
//! let redirection_entry = bit_ops::bitops_u64::set_bits_exact_n(
//!     0,
//!     &[
//!         (7, VECTOR_BITS, VECTOR_SHIFT),
//!         (0b111 /* ExtInt */, DELIVERY_MODE_BITS, DELIVERY_MODE_SHIFT),
//!         (0 /* physical */, DESTINATION_MODE_BITS, DESTINATION_MODE_SHIFT),
//!         (1 /* low-active */, PIN_POLARITY_BITS, PIN_POLARITY_SHIFT),
//!         (1 /* level-triggered */, TRIGGER_MODE_BITS, TRIGGER_MODE_SHIFT),
//!         (1 /* masked */, MASKED_BITS, MASKED_SHIFT),
//!         (13 /* APIC ID */, DESTINATION_BITS, DESTINATION_SHIFT),
//!     ],
//! );
//! assert_eq!(redirection_entry, 0xd0000000001a707);
//! ```
//!
//! ### Trait API
//!
//! The trait [`BitOps`] is implemented for [`u8`], [`u16`], [`u32`], [`u64`],
//! [`u128`], and [`usize`]. It provides the same functionality as the function
//! API, but you call each operation as associated function.
//!
//! #### Example
//!
//! Unlike in the Function API, you can use chaining here:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bit_ops::BitOps;
//!
//! let raw = 0_u64.set_bit(1).set_bit(2);
//! assert_eq!(raw, 0b110);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Comparison to other Crates
//!
//! `bit_ops` (this crate) is fresher, more feature-complete, and fully `no_std`
//! and `const` compatible compared to `bit_op`, `bitops`, and `bitwise`. Unlike
//! in `bitwise` for example, functionality from `libcore` is not replicated.
